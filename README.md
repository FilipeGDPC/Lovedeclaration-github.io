# Proposal System

Welcome to the Proposal System project! This project is a fun way to propose to your loved one using a simple HTML and CSS webpage. Below are the details and steps to make your proposal:

## Files

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file for the Proposal Page. It contains the proposal question and options for "Yes" and "No".
- **text.htm**: This file contains additional text or content for the proposal. It is displayed after selecting "Yes" on the main proposal page.

## Proposal Page

The Proposal Page is designed to ask a simple question: "Will you spend the rest of your life with me?" with options for "Yes" and "No". However, in this special case, only the "Yes" option is allowed to be selected. When you try to select "No", it will move away from the option, leaving only the "Yes" option selectable.

## Declaration

After selecting "Yes", you will be taken to a declaration page (text.htm) where you'll find additional content or text for the proposal.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Experience the proposal page by clicking on the appropriate options.
4. After selecting "Yes", proceed to the declaration page (text.htm) where you'll find additional content.
